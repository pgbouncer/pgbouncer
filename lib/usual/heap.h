/** @file
 * Binary heap.
 *
 * Binary heap is sort of binary tree held inside array,
 * with following 2 properties:
 * - heap property: each node is "better" than it's childs.
 * - shape property: binary tree is complete, meaning all levels
 *   except the last one are fully filled.
 *
 * Instead of "min"- or "max"-heap, this is "best"-heap,
 * as it operates with user-defined heap_is_better() functions,
 * which is used to bubble elements on top.
