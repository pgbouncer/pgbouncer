= Libusual/Antimake Build Demos =

Here are few demos showing how to use both Libusual and Antimake
in various scenarios.  If you wonder why there is so many of them,
the reason is that these demos are also used as regressions tests
for various functionality.  (Thus, 'temos')

They are ordered in ascending complexity, so pick first one if you
want simplest overview.
