## Description

**pgbouncer** is a PostgreSQL connection pooler. Any target application
can be connected to **pgbouncer** as if it were a PostgreSQL server,
and **pgbouncer** will create a connection to the actual server, or it
will reuse one of its existing connections.

The aim of **pgbouncer** is to lower the performance impact of opening
new connections to PostgreSQL.

In order not to compromise transaction semantics for connection
pooling, **pgbouncer** supports several types of pooling when
rotating connections:

Session pooling

:   Most polite method. When client connects, a server connection will
    be assigned to it for the whole duration the client stays connected. When
    the client disconnects, the server connection will be put back into the pool.
    This is the default method.

Transaction pooling

:   A server connection is assigned to client only during a transaction.
    When PgBouncer notices that transaction is over, the server connection
    will be put back into the pool.

Statement pooling

:   Most aggressive method. The server connection will be put back into
    pool immediately after a query completes. Multi-statement
    transactions are disallowed in this mode as they would break.

The administration interface of **pgbouncer** consists of some new
``SHOW`` commands available when connected to a special "virtual"
database **pgbouncer**.

## Quick-start

Basic setup and usage as following.

1. Create a pgbouncer.ini file.  Details in **pgbouncer(5)**.  Simple example:

        [databases]
        template1 = host=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=template1

        [pgbouncer]
        listen_port = 6543
        listen_addr = 127.0.0.1
        auth_type = md5
        auth_file = users.txt
        logfile = pgbouncer.log
        pidfile = pgbouncer.pid
        admin_users = someuser

2. Create ``users.txt`` file that contains users allowed in:

        "someuser" "same_password_as_in_server"

3. Launch **pgbouncer**:

        $ pgbouncer -d pgbouncer.ini

4. Have your application (or the **psql** client) connect to
   **pgbouncer** instead of directly to PostgreSQL server:

        $ psql -p 6543 -U someuser template1

5. Manage **pgbouncer** by connecting to the special administration
   database **pgbouncer** and issuing ``show help;`` to begin:

        $ psql -p 6543 -U someuser pgbouncer
        pgbouncer=# show help;
        NOTICE:  Console usage
        DETAIL:
          SHOW [HELP|CONFIG|DATABASES|FDS|POOLS|CLIENTS|SERVERS|SOCKETS|LISTS|VERSION|...]
          SET key = arg
          RELOAD
          PAUSE
          SUSPEND
          RESUME
          SHUTDOWN
          [...]

6. If you made changes to the pgbouncer.ini file, you can reload it with:

        pgbouncer=# RELOAD;

## Command line switches

-d
:   Run in background. Without it the process will run in foreground.
    Note: Does not work on Windows, **pgbouncer** need to run as service there.

-R
:   Do an online restart. That means connecting to the running process,
    loading the open sockets from it, and then using them.  If there
    is no active process, boot normally.
    Note: Works only if OS supports Unix sockets and the `unix_socket_dir`
    is not disabled in config.  Does not work on Windows machines.
    Does not work with TLS connections, they are dropped.

-u user
:   Switch to the given user on startup.

-v
:   Increase verbosity.  Can be used multiple times.

-q
:   Be quiet - do not log to stdout.  Note this does not affect
    logging verbosity, only that stdout is not to be used.
    For use in init.d scripts.

-V
:   Show version.

-h
:   Show short help.

--regservice
:   Win32: Register pgbouncer to run as Windows service.  The **service_name**
    config parameter value is used as name to register under.

--unregservice
:   Win32: Unregister Windows service.

## Admin console

The console is available by connecting as normal to the
database **pgbouncer**:

    $ psql -p 6543 pgbouncer

Only users listed in configuration parameters **admin_users** or **stats_users**
are allowed to login to the console.  (Except when `auth_type=any`, then
any user is allowed in as a stats_user.)

Additionally, the username **pgbouncer** is allowed to log in without password,
if the login comes via Unix socket and the client has same Unix user UID
as the running process.

:   Server connections that linked to client.

sv_idle
:   Server connections that unused and immediately usable for client queries.

#### SHOW FDS;

Internal command - shows list of file descriptors in use with internal state attached to them.

When the connected user has user name "pgbouncer", connects through Unix socket
and has same UID as the running process, the actual FDs are passed over the connection.
This mechanism is used to do an online restart.
Note: This does not work on Windows machines.

This command also blocks the internal event loop, so it should not be used
while PgBouncer is in use.

user
:   User of the connection using the FD.

:   Cancel key for this connection.

link
:   fd for corresponding server/client.  NULL if idle.

#### SHOW CONFIG;

Show the current configuration settings, one per row, with following
columns:

key
:   Configuration variable name

value
:   Configuration value

changeable
:   Either **yes** or **no**, shows if the variable can be changed while running.
    If **no**, the variable can be changed only at boot time.  Use
    **SET** to change a variable at run time.

#### SHOW DNS_HOSTS;

Show host names in DNS cache.

hostname
:   Host name.

ttl
:   How many seconds until next lookup.

addrs

zonename
:   Zone name.

serial
:   Current serial.

count
:   Host names belonging to this zone.


### Process controlling commands

#### PAUSE [db];

PgBouncer tries to disconnect from all servers, first waiting for all queries
to complete. The command will not return before all queries are finished.  To be used
at the time of database restart.

If database name is given, only that database will be paused.

New client connections to a paused database will wait until **RESUME**
is called.

#### DISABLE db;

Reject all new client connections on the given database.

#### ENABLE db;

Allow new client connections after a previous **DISABLE** command.

#### RECONNECT [db];

Close each open server connection for the given database, or all
databases, after it is released (according to the pooling mode), even
if its lifetime is not up yet.  New server connections can be made
immediately and will connect as necessary according to the pool size
settings.

This command is useful when the server connection setup has changed,
for example to perform a gradual switchover to a new server.  It is
*not* necessary to run this command when the connection string in
pgbouncer.ini has been changed and reloaded (see **RELOAD**) or when
DNS resolution has changed, because then the equivalent of this
command will be run automatically.  This command is only necessary if
something downstream of PgBouncer routes the connections.

After this command is run, there could be an extended period where
some server connections go to an old destination and some server
connections go to a new destination.  This is likely only sensible
when switching read-only traffic between read-only replicas, or when
switching between nodes of a multimaster replication setup.  If all
connections need to be switched at the same time, **PAUSE** is
recommended instead.  To close server connections without waiting (for
example, in emergency failover rather than gradual switchover
scenarios), also consider **KILL**.

#### KILL db;

Immediately drop all client and server connections on given database.

New client connections to a killed database will wait until **RESUME**
is called.

#### SUSPEND;

All socket buffers are flushed and PgBouncer stops listening for data on them.
The command will not return before all buffers are empty.  To be used at the time
of PgBouncer online reboot.

New client connections to a suspended database will wait until
**RESUME** is called.

#### RESUME [db];

Resume work from previous **KILL**, **PAUSE**, or **SUSPEND** command.

#### SHUTDOWN;

The PgBouncer process will exit.

#### RELOAD;

The PgBouncer process will reload its configuration file and update
changeable settings.

PgBouncer notices when a configuration file reload changes the
connection parameters of a database definition.  An existing server
connection to the old destination will be closed when the server
connection is next released (according to the pooling mode), and new
server connections will immediately use the updated connection
parameters.

#### WAIT_CLOSE [<db>];

Wait until all server connections, either of the specified database or
of all databases, have cleared the "close_needed" state (see **SHOW
SERVERS**).  This can be called after a **RECONNECT** or **RELOAD** to
wait until the respective configuration change has been fully
activated, for example in switchover scripts.

### Other commands

#### SET key = arg;

Changes a configuration setting (see also **SHOW CONFIG**).  For example:

    SET log_connections = 1;
    SET server_check_query = 'select 2';

(Note that this command is run on the PgBouncer admin console and sets
PgBouncer settings.  A **SET** command run on another database will be
passed to the PostgreSQL backend like any other SQL command.)

### Signals

SIGHUP
:   Reload config. Same as issuing the command **RELOAD;** on the console.

SIGINT
:   Safe shutdown. Same as issuing **PAUSE;** and **SHUTDOWN;** on the console.

SIGTERM
:   Immediate shutdown. Same as issuing **SHUTDOWN;** on the console.

SIGUSR1
:   Same as issuing **PAUSE;** on the console.

SIGUSR2
:   Same as issuing **RESUME;** on the console.

### Libevent settings

From libevent docs:

> It is possible to disable support for epoll, kqueue, devpoll, poll
> or select by setting the environment variable EVENT_NOEPOLL,
> EVENT_NOKQUEUE, EVENT_NODEVPOLL, EVENT_NOPOLL or EVENT_NOSELECT,
> respectively.
>
> By setting the environment variable EVENT_SHOW_METHOD, libevent
> displays the kernel notification method that it uses.
