/*
 * Self-balancing binary tree.
 *
 * Here is an implementation of AA-tree (Arne Andersson tree)
 * which is simplification of Red-Black tree.
 *
 * Red-black tree has following properties that must be kept:
 * 1. A node is either red or black.
 * 2. The root is black.
 * 3. All leaves (NIL nodes) are black.
 * 4. Both childen of red node are black.
 * 5. Every path from root to leaf contains same number of black nodes.
 *
 * AA-tree adds additional property:
 * 6. Red node can exist only as a right node.
 *
 * Red-black tree properties quarantee that the longest path is max 2x longer
 * than shortest path (B-R-B-R-B-R-B vs. B-B-B-B) thus the tree will be roughly
 * balanced.  Also it has good worst-case guarantees for insertion and deletion,
 * which makes it good tool for real-time applications.
 *
 * AA-tree removes most special cases from RB-tree, thus making resulting
 * code lot simpler.  It requires slightly more rotations when inserting
 * and deleting but also keeps the tree more balanced.
