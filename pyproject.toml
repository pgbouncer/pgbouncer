# The asyncio_mode setting doesn't work on outdated versions of pytest-asyncio.
# For python 3.6 no version is available that supports the asyncio_mode
# setting, and for some of the older OSes Python 3.6 is the newest python
# available. So @pytest.mark.asyncio is used everywhere instead. Once none of
# our supported OSes require usage we can drop those marks and rely on the
# asyncio_mode setting instead.
# On these outdated versions having this setting in the config will throw a
# warning, but we still add it anyway. The reason is that by adding it async
# fixtures work on all versions, and are pretty much impossible to make work
# otherwise without lots of version checks. So having a warning on outdated
# versions is a small price to pay to not have to worry about that.
