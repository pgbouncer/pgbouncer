# pgbouncer.ini


## Description

The configuration file is in "ini" format. Section names are between "[" and "]".  Lines
starting with ";" or "#" are taken as comments and ignored. The characters ";"
and "#" are not recognized as special when they appear later in the line.


## Generic settings

### logfile

Specifies the log file.  For daemonization (`-d`), either this or
`syslog` need to be set.

The log file is kept open, so after rotation, `kill -HUP`
or on console `RELOAD;` should be done.
On Windows, the service must be stopped and started.

Note that setting `logfile` does not by itself turn off logging to
stderr.  Use the command-line option `-q` or `-d` for that.

Default: not set

### pidfile

Specifies the PID file. Without `pidfile` set, daemonization (`-d`) is not allowed.

Default: not set

### listen_addr

Specifies a list (comma-separated) of addresses where to listen for TCP connections.
You may also use `*` meaning "listen on all addresses". When not set,
only Unix socket connections are accepted.

Addresses can be specified numerically (IPv4/IPv6) or by name.

Default: not set

### listen_port

Which port to listen on. Applies to both TCP and Unix sockets.

Default: 6432

### unix_socket_dir

Specifies the location for Unix sockets. Applies to both the listening socket and to
server connections. If set to an empty string, Unix sockets are disabled.
A value that starts with `@` specifies that a Unix socket in the
abstract namespace should be created (currently supported on Linux and
Windows).

For online reboot (`-R`) to work, a Unix socket needs to be
configured, and it needs to be in the file-system namespace.

Default: `/tmp` (empty on Windows)

### unix_socket_mode

File system mode for Unix socket.
Ignored for sockets in the abstract namespace.
Not supported on Windows.

Default: 0777

### unix_socket_group

Group name to use for Unix socket.
Ignored for sockets in the abstract namespace.
Not supported on Windows.

Default: not set

### user

If set, specifies the Unix user to change to after startup. Works only if
PgBouncer is started as root or if it's already running as the given user.
Not supported on Windows.

Default: not set

### pool_mode

Specifies when a server connection can be reused by other clients.

session
:   Server is released back to pool after client disconnects.  Default.

transaction
:   Server is released back to pool after transaction finishes.

statement
:   Server is released back to pool after query finishes. Transactions
    spanning multiple statements are disallowed in this mode.

### max_client_conn

Maximum number of client connections allowed.

When this setting is increased, then the file descriptor limits in the
operating system might also have to be increased.  Note that the
number of file descriptors potentially used is more than
`max_client_conn`.  If each user connects under its own user name to
the server, the theoretical maximum used is:

    max_client_conn + (max pool_size * total databases * total users)

If a database user
is specified in the connection string (all users connect under the same user name),
the theoretical maximum is:

    max_client_conn + (max pool_size * total databases)

The theoretical maximum should never be reached, unless somebody deliberately
crafts a special load for it.  Still, it means you should set the number of
file descriptors to a safely high number.

Search for `ulimit` in your favorite shell man page.
Note: `ulimit` does not apply in a Windows environment.

Default: 100

### default_pool_size

How many server connections to allow per user/database pair. Can be overridden in
the per-database configuration.

Default: 20

### min_pool_size

Add more server connections to pool if below this number.
Improves behavior when the normal load suddently comes back after a period
of total inactivity.  The value is effectively capped at the pool size.

Default: 0 (disabled)

### reserve_pool_size

How many additional connections to allow to a pool (see `reserve_pool_timeout`). 0 disables.

Default: 0 (disabled)

### reserve_pool_timeout

If a client has not been serviced in this time,
use additional connections from the reserve pool.  0 disables.  [seconds]

Default: 5.0

### max_db_connections

Do not allow more than this many server connections per database
(regardless of user).  This considers the PgBouncer database that the
client has connected to, not the PostgreSQL database of the outgoing
connection.

This can also be set per database in the `[databases]` section.

Note that when you hit the limit, closing a client connection to one
pool will not immediately allow a server connection to be established
for another pool, because the server connection for the first pool is
still open.  Once the server connection closes (due to idle timeout),
a new server connection will immediately be opened for the waiting
pool.

Default: 0 (unlimited)

### max_user_connections

Do not allow more than this many server connections per user
(regardless of database).  This considers the PgBouncer user that is
associated with a pool, which is either the user specified for the
server connection or in absence of that the user the client has
connected as.

This can also be set per user in the `[users]` section.

Note that when you hit the limit, closing a client connection to one
pool will not immediately allow a server connection to be established
for another pool, because the server connection for the first pool is
still open.  Once the server connection closes (due to idle timeout),
a new server connection will immediately be opened for the waiting
pool.

Default: 0 (unlimited)

### server_round_robin

By default, PgBouncer reuses server connections in LIFO (last-in, first-out) manner,
so that few connections get the most load.  This gives best performance if you have
a single server serving a database.  But if there is a round-robin
system behind a database address (TCP, DNS, or host list), then it is
better if PgBouncer also uses connections in that manner, thus
achieving uniform load.

Default: 0

### ignore_startup_parameters

By default, PgBouncer allows only parameters it can keep track of in startup
packets: `client_encoding`, `datestyle`, `timezone` and `standard_conforming_strings`.
All others parameters will raise an error.  To allow others parameters, they can be
specified here, so that PgBouncer knows that they are handled by the admin and it can ignore them.

Default: empty

### disable_pqexec

Disable the Simple Query protocol (PQexec).  Unlike the Extended Query protocol, Simple Query
allows multiple queries in one packet, which allows some classes of SQL-injection
attacks.  Disabling it can improve security.  Obviously, this means only clients that
exclusively use the Extended Query protocol will stay working.

Default: 0

### application_name_add_host

Add the client host address and port to the application name setting set on connection start.
This helps in identifying the source of bad queries etc.  This logic applies
only at the start of a connection.  If `application_name` is later changed with `SET`,
PgBouncer does not change it again.

Default: 0

### conffile

Show location of current config file.  Changing it will make PgBouncer use another
config file for next `RELOAD` / `SIGHUP`.

Default: file from command line

### service_name

Used on win32 service registration.

Default: `pgbouncer`

### job_name

Alias for `service_name`.

### stats_period

Sets how often the averages shown in various `SHOW` commands are
updated and how often aggregated statistics are written to the log
(but see `log_stats`). [seconds]

Default: 60


## Authentication settings

PgBouncer handles its own client authentication and has its own
database of users.  These settings control this.

### auth_type

How to authenticate users.

cert
:   Client must connect over TLS connection with a valid client certificate.
    The user name is then taken from the CommonName field from the certificate.

md5
:   Use MD5-based password check.  This is the default authentication
    method.  `auth_file` may contain both MD5-encrypted and plain-text
    passwords.  If `md5` is configured and a user has a SCRAM secret,
    then SCRAM authentication is used automatically instead.

scram-sha-256
:   Use password check with SCRAM-SHA-256.  `auth_file` has to contain
    SCRAM secrets or plain-text passwords.

plain
:   The clear-text password is sent over the wire.  Deprecated.

trust
:   No authentication is done. The user name must still exist in `auth_file`.

any
:   Like the `trust` method, but the user name given is ignored. Requires that all
    databases are configured to log in as a specific user.  Additionally, the console
    database allows any user to log in as admin.

hba
:   The actual authentication type is loaded from `auth_hba_file`.  This allows different
    authentication methods for different access paths, for example: connections
    over Unix socket use the `peer` auth method, connections over TCP
    must use TLS.

pam
:   PAM is used to authenticate users, `auth_file` is ignored. This method is not
    compatible with databases using the `auth_user` option. The service name reported to
    PAM is "pgbouncer". `pam` is not supported in the HBA configuration file.

### auth_hba_file

HBA configuration file to use when `auth_type` is `hba`.

Default: not set

### auth_file

The name of the file to load user names and passwords from.  See
section [Authentication file format](#authentication-file-format) below about details.

Most authentication types (see above) require that either `auth_file`
or `auth_user` be set; otherwise there would be no users defined.

Default: not set

### auth_user

If `auth_user` is set, then any user not specified in `auth_file` will be
queried through the `auth_query` query from pg_shadow in the database,
using `auth_user`. The password of `auth_user` will be taken from `auth_file`.
(If the `auth_user` does not require a password then it does not need
to be defined in `auth_file`.)

Direct access to pg_shadow requires admin rights.  It's preferable to
use a non-superuser that calls a SECURITY DEFINER function instead.

Default: not set

### auth_query

Query to load user's password from database.

Direct access to pg_shadow requires admin rights.  It's preferable to
use a non-superuser that calls a SECURITY DEFINER function instead.

Note that the query is run inside the target database.  So if a function
is used, it needs to be installed into each database.

Default: `SELECT usename, passwd FROM pg_shadow WHERE usename=$1`


## Log settings

### syslog

Toggles syslog on/off.
On Windows, the event log is used instead.

Default: 0

### syslog_ident

Under what name to send logs to syslog.

Default: `pgbouncer` (program name)

### syslog_facility

Under what facility to send logs to syslog.
Possibilities: `auth`, `authpriv`, `daemon`, `user`, `local0-7`.

Default: `daemon`

### log_connections

Log successful logins.

Default: 1

### log_disconnections

Log disconnections with reasons.

Default: 1

### log_pooler_errors

Log error messages the pooler sends to clients.

Default: 1

### log_stats

Write aggregated statistics into the log, every `stats_period`.  This
can be disabled if external monitoring tools are used to grab the same
data from `SHOW` commands.

Default: 1

### verbose

Increase verbosity.  Mirrors the "-v" switch on the command line.
For example, using "-v -v" on the command line is the same as `verbose=2`.

Default: 0


## Console access control

### admin_users

Comma-separated list of database users that are allowed to connect and
run all commands on the console.  Ignored when `auth_type` is `any`,
in which case any user name is allowed in as admin.

Default: empty

### stats_users

Comma-separated list of database users that are allowed to connect and
run read-only queries on the console. That means all `SHOW` commands except
`SHOW FDS`.

Default: empty


## Connection sanity checks, timeouts

### server_reset_query

Query sent to server on connection release, before making it
available to other clients.  At that moment no transaction is in
progress, so the value should not include `ABORT` or `ROLLBACK`.

The query is supposed to clean any changes made to the database session
so that the next client gets the connection in a well-defined state.  The default is
`DISCARD ALL`, which cleans everything, but that leaves the next client
no pre-cached state.  It can be made lighter, e.g. `DEALLOCATE ALL`
to just drop prepared statements, if the application does not break when
some state is kept around.

When transaction pooling is used, the `server_reset_query` is not used,
because in that mode, clients must not use any session-based features, since each transaction
ends up in a different connection and thus gets a different session state.

Default: `DISCARD ALL`

### server_reset_query_always

Whether `server_reset_query` should be run in all pooling modes.  When this
setting is off (default), the `server_reset_query` will be run only in pools
that are in sessions-pooling mode.  Connections in transaction-pooling mode
should not have any need for a reset query.

This setting is for working around broken setups that run applications that use session features
over a transaction-pooled PgBouncer.  It changes non-deterministic breakage
to deterministic breakage: Clients always lose their state after each
transaction.

Default: 0

### server_check_delay

How long to keep released connections available for immediate re-use, without running
`server_check_query` on it. If 0 then the check is always run.

Default: 30.0

### server_check_query

Simple do-nothing query to check if the server connection is alive.

If an empty string, then sanity checking is disabled.

Default: `select 1`

### server_fast_close

Disconnect a server in session pooling mode immediately or after the
end of the current transaction if it is in "close_needed" mode (set by
`RECONNECT`, `RELOAD` that changes connection settings, or DNS
change), rather than waiting for the session end.  In statement or
transaction pooling mode, this has no effect since that is the default
behavior there.

If because of this setting a server connection is closed before the
end of the client session, the client connection is also closed.  This
ensures that the client notices that the session has been interrupted.

This setting makes connection configuration changes take effect sooner
if session pooling and long-running sessions are used.  The downside
is that client sessions are liable to be interrupted by a
configuration change, so client applications will need logic to
reconnect and reestablish session state.  But note that no
transactions will be lost, because running transactions are not
interrupted, only idle sessions.

Default: 0

### server_lifetime

The pooler will close an unused (not currently linked to any client connection)
server connection that has been connected longer
than this. Setting it to 0 means the connection is to be used only once,
then closed. [seconds]

Default: 3600.0

### server_idle_timeout

If a server connection has been idle more than this many seconds it will be closed.
If 0 then this timeout is disabled.  [seconds]

Default: 600.0

### server_connect_timeout

If connection and login don't finish in this amount of time, the connection
will be closed. [seconds]

Default: 15.0

### server_login_retry

If login to the server failed, because of failure to connect or from
authentication, the pooler waits this much before retrying to connect.
During the waiting interval, new clients trying to connect to the
failing server will get an error immediately without another
connection attempt. [seconds]

The purpose of this behavior is that clients don't unnecessarily queue
up waiting for a server connection to become available if the server
is not working.  However, it also means that if a server is
momentarily failing, for example during a restart or if the
configuration was erroneous, then it will take at least this long
until the pooler will consider connecting to it again.  Planned events
such as restarts should normally be managed using the `PAUSE` command
to avoid this.

Default: 15.0

### client_login_timeout

If a client connects but does not manage to log in in this amount of time, it
will be disconnected. Mainly needed to avoid dead connections stalling
`SUSPEND` and thus online restart. [seconds]

Default: 60.0

### autodb_idle_timeout

If the automatically created (via "*") database pools have
been unused this many seconds, they are freed.  The negative
aspect of that is that their statistics are also forgotten.  [seconds]

Default: 3600.0

### dns_max_ttl

How long DNS lookups can be cached.  The actual DNS TTL is ignored.
[seconds]

Default: 15.0

### dns_nxdomain_ttl

How long DNS errors and NXDOMAIN DNS lookups can be cached. [seconds]

Default: 15.0

### dns_zone_check_period

Period to check if a zone serial has changed.

PgBouncer can collect DNS zones from host names (everything after first dot)
and then periodically check if the zone serial changes.
If it notices changes, all host names under that zone
are looked up again.  If any host IP changes, its connections
are invalidated.

Works only with UDNS and c-ares backends (`configure` option `--with-udns` or `--with-cares`).

Default: 0.0 (disabled)

### resolv_conf

The location of a custom `resolv.conf` file.  This is to allow
specifying custom DNS servers and perhaps other name resolution
options, independent of the global operating system configuration.

Requires evdns (>= 2.0.3) or c-ares (>= 1.15.0) backend.

The parsing of the file is done by the DNS backend library, not
PgBouncer, so see the library's documentation for details on allowed
syntax and directives.

Default: empty (use operating system defaults)


## TLS settings

### client_tls_sslmode

TLS mode to use for connections from clients.  TLS connections
are disabled by default.  When enabled, `client_tls_key_file`
and `client_tls_cert_file` must be also configured to set up
the key and certificate PgBouncer uses to accept client connections.

disable
:   Plain TCP.  If client requests TLS, it's ignored.  Default.

allow
:   If client requests TLS, it is used.  If not, plain TCP is used.
    If the client presents a client certificate, it is not validated.

prefer
:   Same as `allow`.

require
:   Client must use TLS.  If not, the client connection is rejected.
    If the client presents a client certificate, it is not validated.

verify-ca
:   Client must use TLS with valid client certificate.

verify-full
:   Same as `verify-ca`.

### client_tls_key_file

Private key for PgBouncer to accept client connections.

Default: not set

### client_tls_cert_file

Certificate for private key.  Clients can validate it.

Default: not set

### client_tls_ca_file

Root certificate file to validate client certificates.

Default: not set

### client_tls_protocols

Which TLS protocol versions are allowed.  Allowed values: `tlsv1.0`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2`, `tlsv1.3`.
Shortcuts: `all` (tlsv1.0,tlsv1.1,tlsv1.2,tlsv1.3), `secure` (tlsv1.2,tlsv1.3), `legacy` (all).

Default: `secure`

### client_tls_ciphers

Allowed TLS ciphers, in OpenSSL syntax.  Shortcuts:
`default`/`secure`, `compat`/`legacy`, `insecure`/`all`, `normal`,
`fast`.

Only connections using TLS version 1.2 and lower are affected.  There
is currently no setting that controls the cipher choices used by TLS
version 1.3 connections.

Default: `fast`

### client_tls_ecdhcurve

Elliptic Curve name to use for ECDH key exchanges.

Allowed values: `none` (DH is disabled), `auto` (256-bit ECDH), curve name

Default: `auto`

### client_tls_dheparams

DHE key exchange type.

Allowed values: `none` (DH is disabled), `auto` (2048-bit DH), `legacy` (1024-bit DH)

Default: `auto`

### server_tls_sslmode

TLS mode to use for connections to PostgreSQL servers.
TLS connections are disabled by default.

disable
:   Plain TCP.  TCP is not even requested from the server.  Default.

allow
:   FIXME: if server rejects plain, try TLS?

prefer
:   TLS connection is always requested first from PostgreSQL.
    If refused, the connection will be established over plain TCP.
    Server certificate is not validated.

require
:   Connection must go over TLS.  If server rejects it,
    plain TCP is not attempted.  Server certificate is not validated.

verify-ca
:   Connection must go over TLS and server certificate must be valid
    according to `server_tls_ca_file`.  Server host name is not checked
    against certificate.

verify-full
:   Connection must go over TLS and server certificate must be valid
    according to `server_tls_ca_file`.  Server host name must match
    certificate information.

### server_tls_ca_file

Root certificate file to validate PostgreSQL server certificates.

Default: not set

### server_tls_key_file

Private key for PgBouncer to authenticate against PostgreSQL server.

Default: not set

### server_tls_cert_file

Certificate for private key.  PostgreSQL server can validate it.

Default: not set

### server_tls_protocols

Which TLS protocol versions are allowed.  Allowed values: `tlsv1.0`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2`, `tlsv1.3`.
Shortcuts: `all` (tlsv1.0,tlsv1.1,tlsv1.2,tlsv1.3), `secure` (tlsv1.2,tlsv1.3), `legacy` (all).

Default: `secure`

### server_tls_ciphers

Allowed TLS ciphers, in OpenSSL syntax.  Shortcuts:
`default`/`secure`, `compat`/`legacy`, `insecure`/`all`, `normal`,
`fast`.

Only connections using TLS version 1.2 and lower are affected.  There
is currently no setting that controls the cipher choices used by TLS
version 1.3 connections.

Default: `fast`


## Dangerous timeouts

Setting the following timeouts can cause unexpected errors.

### query_timeout

Queries running longer than that are canceled. This should be used only with
a slightly smaller server-side `statement_timeout`, to apply only for network
problems. [seconds]

Default: 0.0 (disabled)

### query_wait_timeout

Maximum time queries are allowed to spend waiting for execution. If the query
is not assigned to a server during that time, the client is disconnected.
0 disables.  If this is disabled, clients will be queued indefinitely. [seconds]

This setting is used to prevent unresponsive servers from grabbing up
connections.  It also helps when the server is down or rejects
connections for any reason.

Default: 120

### client_idle_timeout

Client connections idling longer than this many seconds are closed. This should
be larger than the client-side connection lifetime settings, and only used
for network problems. [seconds]

Default: 0.0 (disabled)

### idle_transaction_timeout

If a client has been in "idle in transaction" state longer,
it will be disconnected.  [seconds]

Default: 0.0 (disabled)

### suspend_timeout

How long to wait for buffer flush during `SUSPEND` or reboot (`-R`).
A connection is dropped if the flush does not succeed. [seconds]

Default: 10


## Low-level network settings

### pkt_buf

Internal buffer size for packets. Affects size of TCP packets sent and general
memory usage. Actual libpq packets can be larger than this, so no need to set it
large.

Default: 4096

### max_packet_size

Maximum size for PostgreSQL packets that PgBouncer allows through.  One packet
is either one query or one result set row.  The full result set can be larger.

Default: 2147483647

### listen_backlog

Backlog argument for listen(2).  Determines how many new unanswered connection
attempts are kept in the queue.  When the queue is full, further new connections are dropped.

Default: 128

### sbuf_loopcnt

How many times to process data on one connection, before proceeding.
Without this limit, one connection with a big result set can stall
PgBouncer for a long time.  One loop processes one `pkt_buf` amount of data.
0 means no limit.

Default: 5

### so_reuseport

Specifies whether to set the socket option `SO_REUSEPORT` on TCP
listening sockets.  On some operating systems, this allows running
multiple PgBouncer instances on the same host listening on the same
port and having the kernel distribute the connections automatically.
This option is a way to get PgBouncer to use more CPU cores.
(PgBouncer is single-threaded and uses one CPU core per instance.)

The behavior in detail depends on the operating system kernel.  As of
this writing, this setting has the desired effect on (sufficiently
recent versions of) Linux, DragonFlyBSD, and FreeBSD.  (On FreeBSD, it
applies the socket option `SO_REUSEPORT_LB` instead.)  Some other
operating systems support the socket option but it won't have the
desired effect: It will allow multiple processes to bind to the same
port but only one of them will get the connections.  See your
operating system's setsockopt() documentation for details.

On systems that don't support the socket option at all, turning this
setting on will result in an error.

Each PgBouncer instance on the same host needs different settings for
at least `unix_socket_dir` and `pidfile`, as well as `logfile` if that
is used.  Also note that if you make use of this option, you can no
longer connect to a specific PgBouncer instance via TCP/IP, which
might have implications for monitoring and metrics collection.

Default: 0

### tcp_defer_accept

Sets the `TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT` socket option; see `man 7 tcp` for
details.  (This is a Boolean option: 1 means enabled.  The actual
value set if enabled is currently hardcoded to 45 seconds.)

This is currently only supported on Linux.

Default: 1 on Linux, otherwise 0

### tcp_socket_buffer

Default: not set

### tcp_keepalive

Turns on basic keepalive with OS defaults.

On Linux, the system defaults are tcp_keepidle=7200, tcp_keepintvl=75,
tcp_keepcnt=9.  They are probably similar on other operating systems.

Default: 1

### tcp_keepcnt

Default: not set

### tcp_keepidle

Default: not set

### tcp_keepintvl

Default: not set

### tcp_user_timeout

Sets the `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` socket option.  This specifies the maximum
amount of time in milliseconds that transmitted data may remain
unacknowledged before the TCP connection is forcibly closed.  If set
to 0, then operating system's default is used.

This is currently only supported on Linux.

Default: 0


## Section [databases]

The section `[databases]` defines the names of the databases that
clients of PgBouncer can connect to and specifies where those
connections will be routed.  The section contains key=value lines like

    dbname = connection string

where the key will be taken as a database name and the value as a
connection string, consisting of key=value pairs of connection
parameters, described below (similar to libpq, but the actual libpq is
not used and the set of available features is different).  Example:

    foodb = host=host1.example.com port=5432
    bardb = host=localhost dbname=bazdb

The database name can contain characters `_0-9A-Za-z` without quoting.
Names that contain other characters need to be quoted with standard SQL
identifier quoting: double quotes, with "" for a single instance of a double quote.

The database name "pgbouncer" is reserved for the admin console and
cannot be used as a key here.

"*" acts as a fallback database: If the exact name does not exist, its
value is taken as connection string for the requested database.  For
example, if there is an entry (and no other overriding entries)

    * = host=foo

then a connection to PgBouncer specifying a database "bar" will
effectively behave as if an entry

    bar = host=foo dbname=bar

exists (taking advantage of the default for `dbname` being the
client-side database name; see below).

Such automatically created database entries are cleaned up
if they stay idle longer than the time specified by the `autodb_idle_timeout`
parameter.

### dbname

Destination database name.

Default: same as client-side database name

### host

Host name or IP address to connect to.  Host names are resolved
at connection time, the result is cached per `dns_max_ttl` parameter.
When a host name's resolution changes, existing server connections are
automatically closed when they are released (according to the pooling
mode), and new server connections immediately use the new resolution.
If DNS returns several results, they are used in a round-robin
manner.

If the value begins with `/`, then a Unix socket in the file-system
namespace is used.  If the value begins with `@`, then a Unix socket
in the abstract namespace is used.

A comma-separated list of host names or addresses can be specified.
In that case, connections are made in a round-robin manner.  (If a
host list contains host names that in turn resolve via DNS to multiple
addresses, the round-robin systems operate independently.  This is an
implementation dependency that is subject to change.)  Note that in a
list, all hosts must be available at all times: There are no
mechanisms to skip unreachable hosts or to select only available hosts
from a list or similar.  (This is different from what a host list in
libpq means.)  Also note that this only affects how the destinations
of new connections are chosen.  See also the setting
`server_round_robin` for how clients are assigned to already
established server connections.

Examples:

	host=localhost
	host=127.0.0.1
	host=2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
	host=/var/run/postgresql
	host=192.168.0.1,192.168.0.2,192.168.0.3

Default: not set, meaning to use a Unix socket

### port

Default: 5432

### user

If `user=` is set, all connections to the destination database will be
done with the specified user, meaning that there will be only one pool
for this database.

Otherwise, PgBouncer logs into the destination database with the client
user name, meaning that there will be one pool per user.

### password

If no password is specified here, the password from the `auth_file` or
`auth_query` will be used.

### auth_user

Override of the global `auth_user` setting, if specified.

### pool_size

Set the maximum size of pools for this database.  If not set,
the `default_pool_size` is used.

### min_pool_size

Set the minimum pool size for this database. If not set, the global `min_pool_size` is
used.

### reserve_pool

Set additional connections for this database. If not set, `reserve_pool_size` is
used.

### connect_query

Query to be executed after a connection is established, but before
allowing the connection to be used by any clients. If the query raises errors,
they are logged but ignored otherwise.

### pool_mode

Set the pool mode specific to this database. If not set,
the default `pool_mode` is used.

### max_db_connections

Configure a database-wide maximum (i.e. all pools within the database will
not have more than this many server connections).

### client_encoding

Ask specific `client_encoding` from server.

### datestyle

Ask specific `datestyle` from server.

### timezone

Ask specific `timezone` from server.


## Section [users]

This section contains key=value lines like

    user1 = settings

where the key will be taken as a user name and the value as a list of
key=value pairs of configuration settings specific for this user.
Example:

    user1 = pool_mode=session

Only a few settings are available here.

### pool_mode

Set the pool mode to be used for all connections from this user. If not set, the
database or default `pool_mode` is used.

### max_user_connections

Configure a maximum for the user (i.e. all pools with the user will
not have more than this many server connections).


## Include directive

The PgBouncer configuration file can contain include directives, which specify
another configuration file to read and process. This allows splitting the
configuration file into physically separate parts. The include directives look
like this:

    %include filename

If the file name is not an absolute path, it is taken as relative to the current
working directory.


## Authentication file format

This section describes the format of the file specified by the
`auth_file` setting.  It is a text file in the following format:

    "username1" "password" ...
    "username2" "md5abcdef012342345" ...
    "username2" "SCRAM-SHA-256$<iterations>:<salt>$<storedkey>:<serverkey>"

There should be at least 2 fields, surrounded by double quotes. The first
field is the user name and the second is either a plain-text, a MD5-hashed
password, or a SCRAM secret.  PgBouncer ignores the rest of the line.
Double quotes in a field value can be escaped by writing two double quotes.

PostgreSQL MD5-hashed password format:

    "md5" + md5(password + username)

So user `admin` with password `1234` will have MD5-hashed password
`md545f2603610af569b6155c45067268c6b`.

PostgreSQL SCRAM secret format:

    SCRAM-SHA-256$<iterations>:<salt>$<storedkey>:<serverkey>

See the PostgreSQL documentation and RFC 5803 for details on this.

The passwords or secrets stored in the authentication file serve two
purposes.  First, they are used to verify the passwords of incoming
client connections, if a password-based authentication method is
configured.  Second, they are used as the passwords for outgoing
connections to the backend server, if the backend server requires
password-based authentication (unless the password is specified
directly in the database's connection string).  The latter works if
the password is stored in plain text or MD5-hashed.  SCRAM secrets can
only be used for logging into a server if the client authentication
also uses SCRAM, the PgBouncer database definition does not specify a
user name, and the SCRAM secrets are identical in PgBouncer and the
PostgreSQL server (same salt and iterations, not merely the same
password).  This is due to an inherent security property of SCRAM: The
stored SCRAM secret cannot by itself be used for deriving login
credentials.

The authentication file can be written by hand, but it's also useful
to generate it from some other list of users and passwords.  See
`./etc/mkauth.py` for a sample script to generate the authentication
file from the `pg_shadow` system table.  Alternatively, use
`auth_query` instead of `auth_file` to avoid having to maintain a
separate authentication file.


## HBA file format

The location of the HBA file is specified by the setting
`auth_hba_file`.  It is only used if `auth_type` is set to `hba`.

The file follows the format of the PostgreSQL `pg_hba.conf` file
(see <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html>).

* Supported record types: `local`, `host`, `hostssl`, `hostnossl`.
* Database field: Supports `all`, `sameuser`, `@file`, multiple names.  Not supported: `replication`, `samerole`, `samegroup`.
* User name field: Supports `all`, `@file`, multiple names.  Not supported: `+groupname`.
* Address field: Supports IPv4, IPv6.  Not supported: DNS names, domain prefixes.
* Auth-method field: Only methods supported by PgBouncer's `auth_type`
  are supported, plus `peer` and `reject`, but except `any` and `pam`, which only work globally.
  User name map (`map=`) parameter is not supported.


## Examples

Small example configuration:

    [databases]
    template1 = host=localhost dbname=template1 auth_user=someuser

    [pgbouncer]
    pool_mode = session
    listen_port = 6432
    listen_addr = localhost
    auth_type = md5
    auth_file = users.txt
    logfile = pgbouncer.log
    pidfile = pgbouncer.pid
    admin_users = someuser
    stats_users = stat_collector

Database examples:

    [databases]

    ; foodb over Unix socket
    foodb =

    ; redirect bardb to bazdb on localhost
    bardb = host=localhost dbname=bazdb

    ; access to destination database will go with single user
    forcedb = host=localhost port=300 user=baz password=foo client_encoding=UNICODE datestyle=ISO

Example of a secure function for `auth_query`:

    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pgbouncer.user_lookup(in i_username text, out uname text, out phash text)
    RETURNS record AS $$
    BEGIN
        SELECT usename, passwd FROM pg_catalog.pg_shadow
        WHERE usename = i_username INTO uname, phash;
        RETURN;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
    REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION pgbouncer.user_lookup(text) FROM public, pgbouncer;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pgbouncer.user_lookup(text) TO pgbouncer;
