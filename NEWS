2012-04-17  -  PgBouncer 1.5.1  -  "Abort, Retry, Ignore?"

  = Features =

    * Parameters to tune permissions on unix socket:
      unix_socket_mode=0777, unix_socket_group=''.

  = Fixes =

    * Allow empty string for server-side variable - this is
      needed to get "application_name" properly working, as it's
      the only parameter that does not have server-side default.

    * If connect string changes, require refresh of server parameters.
      Previously PgBouncer continued with old parameters,
      which breaks in case of Postgres upgrade.

    * If autodb connect string changes, drop old connections.

    * cf_setint: Use strtol() instead atoi() to parse integer config
      parameters.  It allows hex, octal and better error detection.

    * Use sigqueue() to detect union sigval existence - fixes
      compilation on HPUX.

    * Remove 'git' command from Makefile, it throws random errors
      in case of plain-tarball build.

    * Document stats_period parameter.  This tunes the period for
      stats output.

    * Require Asciidoc >= 8.4, seems docs are not compatible with
      earlier versions anymore.

    * Stop trying to retry on EINTR from close().

2012-01-05  -  PgBouncer 1.5  -  "Bouncing Satisified Clients Since 2007"

  If you use more than 8 IPs behind one DNS name, you now need to
  use EDNS0 protocol to query.  Only getaddrinfo_a()/getaddrinfo()
  and UDNS backends support it, libevent 1.x/2.x does not.
  To enable it for libc, add 'options edns0' to /etc/resolv.conf.

  GNU Make 3.81+ is required for building.

  = Features =

    * Detect DNS reply changes and invalidate connections to IPs no longer
      present in latest reply.
      (Petr Jelinek)

    * DNS zone serial based hostname invalidation.  When option
      dns_zone_check_period is set, all DNS zones will be queried
      for SOA, and when serial has changed, all hostnames
      will be queried.  This is needed to get deterministic
      connection invalidation, because invalidation on lookup
      is useless when no lookups are performed.
      Works only with new UDNS backend.

    * New SHOW DNS_HOSTS, SHOW DNS_ZONES commands to examine DNS cache.

    * New param: min_pool_size - avoids dropping all connections
      when there is no load.
      (Filip Rembiałkowski)

    * idle_in_transaction_timeout - kill transaction if idle too long.
      Not set by default.

    * New libudns backend for DNS lookups.  More featureful than evdns.
      Use --with-udns to activate.  Does not work with IPv6 yet.

    * KILL command, to immediately kill all connections for one database.
      (Michael Tharp)

    * Move to Antimake build system to have better looking Makefiles.
      Now GNU Make 3.81+ is required for building.

  = Fixes =

    * DNS now works with IPv6 hostnames.

    * Don't change connection state when NOTIFY arrives from server.

    * Various documentation fixes.
      (Dan McGee)

    * Console: Support ident quoting with "".  Originally we did not
      have any commands that took database names, so no quoting was needed.

    * Console: allow numbers at the stard of word regex.  Trying
      to use strict parser makes things too complex here.

    * Don't expire auto DBs that are paused.
      (Michael Tharp)

    * Create auto databases as needed when doing PAUSE.
      (Michael Tharp)

    * Fix wrong log message issued by RESUME command.
      (Peter Eisentraut)

    * When user= without password= is in database connect string,
      password will be taken from userlist.

    * Parse '*' properly in takeover code.

    * autogen.sh: work with older autoconf/automake.

    * Fix run-as-service crash on win32 due to bad basename() from
      mingw/msvc runtime.  Now compat basename() is always used.

2011-06-16  -  PgBouncer 1.4.2  -  "Strike-First Algorithm"

  Affected OS-es: *BSD, Solaris, Win32.

  = Portability Fixes =

    * Give CFLAGS to linker.  Needed when using pthread-based
      getaddrinfo_a() fallback.

    * lib/find_modules.sh: Replace split() with index()+substr().
      This should make it work with older AWKs.

    * <usual/endian.h>: Ignore system htoX/Xtoh defines.  There
      may be only subset of macros defined.

    * <usual/signal.h>: Separate compat sigval from compat sigevent

    * <usual/socket.h>: Include <sys/uio.h> to get iovec

    * <usual/time.h>: Better function autodetection on win32

    * <usual/base_win32.h>: Remove duplicate sigval/sigevent declaration

2011-04-01  -  PgBouncer 1.4.1  -  "It Was All An Act"

  = Features =

    * Support listening/connect for IPv6 addresses.
      (Hannu Krosing)

    * Multiple listen addresses in 'listen_addr'.  For each getaddrinfo()
      is called, so names can also be used.

    * console: Send PgBouncer version as 'server_version' to client.

  = Important Fixes =

    * Disable getaddrinfo_a() on glibc < 2.9 as it crashes on older versions.

      Notable affected OS'es: RHEL/CentOS 5.x (glibc 2.5), Ubuntu 8.04 (glibc 2.7).
      Also Debian/lenny (glibc 2.7) which has non-crashing getaddrinfo_a()
      but we have no good way to detect it.

      Please use libevent 2.x on such OS'es, fallback getaddrinfo_a() is not
      meant for production systems.  And read new 'DNS lookup support' section
      in README to see how DNS backend is picked.

      (Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski, Dominique Hermsdorff, David Sommerseth)

    * Default to --enable-evdns if libevent 2.x is used.

    * Turn on tcp_keepalive by default, as that's what Postgres also does.
      (Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski)

    * Set default server_reset_query to DISCARD ALL to be compatible
      with Postgres by default.

    * win32: Fix crashes with NULL unix socket addr.
      (Hiroshi Saito)

    * Fix autodb cleanup: old cleanup code was mixing up databases and pools
      - as soon as one empty pool was found, the database was tagged as 'idle',
      potentially later killing database with active users.

      Reported-By: Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski

  = Fixes =

    * Make compat getaddrinfo_a() non-blocking, by using single parallel
      thread to do lookups.

    * Enable pthread compilation if compat getaddrinfo_a is used.

    * release_server missed setting ->last_lifetime_disconnect on lifetime disconnect.
      (Emmanuel Courreges)

    * win32: fix auth file on DOS line endings - load_file() did not take
      account of file shringage when loading.
      (Rich Schaaf)

    * <usual/endian.h>: add autoconf detection for enc/dec functions
      so it would not create conflicts on BSD.
      (James Pye)

    * Don't crash when config file does not exist.
      (Lou Picciano)

    * Don't crash on DNS lookup failure when logging on noise level (-v -v).
      (Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski, Dominique Hermsdorff)

    * Use backticks instead of $(cmd) in find_modules.sh to make it more portable.
      (Lou Picciano)

    * Use 'awk' instead of 'sed' in find_modules.sh to make it more portable.
      (Giorgio Valoti)

    * Log active async DNS backend info on startup.

    * Fix --disable-evdns to mean 'no' instead 'yes'.

    * Mention in docs that -R requires unix_socket_dir.

    * Discuss server_reset_query in faq.txt.

    * Restore lost memset in slab allocator

    * Various minor portability fixes in libusual.

2011-01-11  -  PgBouncer 1.4  -  "Gore Code"

  = Features =

    * Async DNS lookup - instead of resolving hostnames at reload time,
      the names are now resolved at connect time, with configurable caching.
      (See dns_max_ttl parameter.)

      By default it uses getaddrinfo_a() (glibc) as backend, if it does not
      exist, then getaddrinfo_a() is emulated via blocking(!) getaddrinfo().

      When --enable-evdns argument to configure, libevent's evdns is used
      as backend.  It is not used by default, because libevent 1.3/1.4
      contain buggy implementation.  Only evdns in libevent 2.0 seems OK.

    * New config var: syslog_ident, to tune syslog name.

    * Proper support for `application_name` startup parameter.

    * Command line long options (Guillaume Lelarge)

    * Solaris portability fixes (Hubert Depesz Lubaczewski)

    * New config var: disable_pqexec.  Highly-paranoid environments
      can disable Simple Query Protocol with that.  Requires apps
      that use only Extended Query Protocol.

    * Postgres compat: if database name is empty in startup packet,
      use user name as database.

  = Fixes =

    * DateStyle and TimeZone server params need to use exact case.

    * Console: send datetime, timezone and stdstr server params to client.

  = Internal cleanups =

    * Use libusual library for low-level utility functions.

    * Remove fixed-length limit from server params.

2010-09-09  -  PgBouncer 1.3.4  -  "Bouncer is always right"

  = Fixes =

    * Apply fast-fail logic at connect time.  So if server is failing,
      the clients get error when connecting.

    * Don't tag automatically generated databases for checking on reload time,
      otherwise they get killed, because they don't exist in config.

    * Ignore application_name parameter by default.  This avoids the need
      for all Postgres 9.0 users to add it into ignore_startup_parameters=
      themselves.

    * Correct pg_auth quoting.  '\' is not used there.

    * Better error reporting on console, show incoming query to user.

    * Support OS'es (OpenBSD) where tv_sec is not time_t.

    * Avoid too noisy warnings on gcc 4.5.

2010-05-10  -  PgBouncer 1.3.3  -  "NSFW"

  = Improvements =

    * Make listen(2) argument configurable: listen_backlog.  This is
      useful on OS'es, where system max allowed is configurable.

    * Improve disconnect messages to show what username or dbname caused
      login to fail.

  = Fixes =

    * Move fast-fail relaunch logic around.  Old one was annoying in case of
      permanently broken databases or users, by trying to retry even if
      there is no clients who want to login.

    * Make logging functions keep old errno, otherwise pgbouncer may act funny
      on higher loglevels and logging problems.

    * Increase the size of various startup-related buffers to handle
      EDB more noisy startup.

    * Detect V2 protocol startup request and give clear reason for disconnect.

2010-03-15  -  PgBouncer 1.3.2  -  "Boomerang Bullet"

  = Fixes =

    * New config var 'query_wait_timeout'.  If client does not get
      server connection in this many seconds, it will be killed.

    * If no server connection in pool and last connect failed, then
      don't put client connections on hold but send error immediately.

      This together with previous fix avoids unnecessary stalls if
      a database has gone down.

    * Track libevent state in sbuf.c to avoid double event_del().  Although
      it usually is safe, it does not seem to work 100%.  Now we should always
      know whether it has been called or not.

    * Disable maintenance during SUSPEND.  Otherwise with short timeouts
      the old bouncer could close few connections after sending them over.

    * Apply client_login_timeout to clients waiting for welcome packet
      (first server connection).  Otherwise they can stay waiting
      infinitely, unless there is query_timeout set.

    * win32: Add switch -U/-P to -regservice to let user pick account
      to run service under.  Old automatic choice between Local Service and
      Local System was not reliable enough.

    * console: Remove \0 from end of text columns.  It was hard to notice,
      as C clients were fine with it.

    * Documentation improvements.  (Greg Sabino Mullane)

    * Clarify few login-related log messages.

    * Change logging level for pooler-sent errors (usually on disconnect) from INFO
      to WARNING, as they signify problems.

    * Change log message for query_timeout to "query timeout".

2009-07-06  -  PgBouncer 1.3.1  -  "Now fully conforming to NSA monitoring requirements"

  = Fixes =

    * Fix problem with sbuf_loopcnt which could make connections hang.
      If query or result length is nearby of multiple of (pktlen*sbuf_loopcnt)
      [10k by default], it could stay waiting for more data which will not
      appear.

    * Make database reconfigure immediate.  Currently old connections
      could be reused after SIGHUP.

    * Fix SHOW DATABASES which was broken due to column addition.

    * Console access was disabled when "auth_mode=any" as pgbouncer dropped username.
      Fix: if "auth_mode=any", allow any user to console as admin.

    * Fix bad CUSTOM_ALIGN macro.  Luckily it's unused if OS already
      defines ALIGN macro thus seems the bug has not happened in wild.

    * win32: call WSAStartup() always, not only in daemon mode
      as config parsing wants to resolve hosts.

    * win32: put quotes around config filename in service
      cmdline to allow spaces in paths.  Executable path
      does not seem to need it due to some win32 magic.

    * Add STATS to SHOW HELP text.

    * doc/usage.txt: the time units in console results are in 
      microseconds, not milliseconds.

2009-02-18  -  PgBouncer 1.3 -  "New Ki-Smash Finishing Move"

  = Features =

    * IANA has assigned port 6432 to be official port for PgBouncer.
      Thus the default port number has changed to 6432.  Existing
      individual users do not need to change, but if you distribute
      packages of PgBouncer, please change the package default
      to official port.

    * Dynamic database creation (David Galoyan)

      Now you can define database with name "*".  If defined, it's connect
      string will be used for all undefined databases.  Useful mostly
      for test / dev environments.

    * Windows support (Hiroshi Saito)

      PgBouncer runs on Windows 2000+ now.  Command line usage stays same,
      except it cannot run as daemon and cannot do online reboot.
      To run as service, define parameter service_name in config. Then:

        > pgbouncer.exe config.ini -regservice
        > net start SERVICE_NAME

      To stop and unregister:

        > net stop SERVICE_NAME
        > pgbouncer.exe config.ini -unregservice

      To use Windows Event Log, event DLL needs to be registered first:

        > regsrv32 pgbevent.dll

      Afterwards you can set "syslog = 1" in config.

  = Minor features =

    * Database names in config file can now be quoted with standard SQL
      ident quoting, to allow non-standard characters in db names.

    * New tunables: 'reserve_pool_size' and 'reserve_pool_timeout'.
      In case there are clients in pool that have waited more that
      'reserve_pool_timeout' seconds, 'reserve_pool_size' specifies
      the number of connections that can be added to pool.  It can also
      set per-pool with 'reserve_pool' connection variable.

    * New tunable 'sbuf_loopcnt' to limit time spent on one socket.

      In some situations - eg SMP server, local Postgres and fast network -
      pgbouncer can run recv()->send() loop many times without blocking
      on either side.  But that means other connections will stall for
      a long time.  To make processing more fair, limit the times
      of doing recv()->send() one socket.  If count reaches limit,
      just proceed processing other sockets.  The processing for
      that socket will resume on next event loop.

      Thanks to Alexander Schöcke for report and testing.

    * crypt() authentication is now optional, as it was removed from Postgres.
      If OS does not provide it, pgbouncer works fine without it.

    * Add milliseconds to log timestamps.

    * Replace old MD5 implementation with more compact one.

    * Update ISC licence with the FSF clarification.

  = Fixes =

    * In case event_del() reports failure, just proceed with cleanup.
      Previously pgbouncer retried it, in case the failure was due ENOMEM.
      But this has caused log floods with inifinite repeats, so it seems
      libevent does not like it.

      Why event_del() report failure first time is still mystery.

    * --enable-debug now just toggles whether debug info is stripped from binary.
      It no longer plays with -fomit-frame-pointer as it's dangerous.

    * Fix include order, as otherwise system includes could come before
      internal ones.  Was problem for new md5.h include file.

    * Include COPYRIGHT file in .tgz...

2008-08-08  -  PgBouncer 1.2.3  -  "Carefully Selected Bytes"

  * Disable SO_ACCEPTFILTER code for BSDs which did not work.
  * Include example etc/userlist.txt in tgz.
  * Use '$(MAKE)' instead 'make' for recursion (Jørgen Austvik)
  * Define _GNU_SOURCE as glibc is useless otherwise.
  * Let the libevent 1.1 pass link test so we can later report "1.3b+ needed"
  * Detect stale pidfile and remove it.

  Thanks to Devrim GÜNDÜZ and Bjoern Metzdorf for problem reports and testing.

2008-08-06  -  PgBouncer 1.2.2  -  "Barf-bag Included"

  * Remove 'drop_on_error', it was a bad idea.  It was added as workaround
    for broken plan cache behaviour in Postgres, but can cause damage
    in common case when some queries always return error.

2008-08-04  -  PgBouncer 1.2.1  -  "Waterproof"

  = Features =

    * New parameter 'drop_on_error' - if server throws error the connection
      will not be reused but dropped after client finished with it.  This is
      needed to refresh plan cache.  Automatic refresh does not work even in 8.3.
      Defaults to 1.

  = Fixes =

    * SHOW SOCKETS/CLIENTS/SERVERS: Don't crash if socket has no buffer.
    * Fix infinite loop on SUSPEND if suspend_timeout triggers.

  = Minor cleanups =

    * Use <sys/uio.h> for 'struct iovec'.
    * Cancel shutdown (from SIGINT) on RESUME/SIGUSR2,
      otherwise it will trigger on next PAUSE.
    * Proper log message if console operation is canceled.

2008-07-29  -  PgBouncer 1.2  -  "Ordinary Magic Flute"

  PgBouncer 1.2 now requires libevent version 1.3b or newer.
  Older libevent versions crash with new restart code.

  = Features =

    * Command line option (-u) and config parameter (user=) to support user
      switching at startup.  Also now pgbouncer refuses to run as root.
      (Jacob Coby)
    * More descriptive usage text (-h).  (Jacob Coby)
    * New database option: connect_query to allow run a query on new
      connections before they are taken into use.  (Teodor Sigaev)
    * New config var 'ignore_startup_parameters' to allow and ignore
      extra parameters in startup packet.  By default only 'database'
      and 'user' are allowed, all others raise error.  This is needed
      to tolerate overenthusiastic JDBC wanting to unconditionally
      set 'extra_float_digits=2' in startup packet.
    * Logging to syslog: new parameters syslog=0/1 and
      syslog_facility=daemon/user/local0.
    * Less scary online restart (-R)
      - Move FD loading before fork, so it logs to console and can be canceled by ^C
      - Keep SHUTDOWN after fork, so ^C would be safe
      - A connect() is attempted to unix socket to see if anyone is listening.
        Now -R can be used even when no previous process was running.  If there
        is previous process, but -R is not used, startup fails.
    * New console commands:
      - SHOW TOTALS that shows stats summary (as goes to log) plus mem usage.
      - SHOW ACTIVE_SOCKETS - like show sockets; but filter only active ones.

  = Less visible features =

    * suspend_timeout - drop stalled conns and long logins. This brings
      additional safety to reboot.
    * When remote database throws error on logging in, notify clients.
    * Removing a database from config and reloading works - all connections
      are killed and the database is removed.
    * Fake some parameters on console SHOW/SET commands to be more Postgres-like.
      That was needed to allow psycopg to connect to console.
      (client_encoding/default_transaction_isolation/datestyle/timezone)
    * Make server_lifetime=0 disconnect server connection immediately
      after first use.  Previously "0" made PgBouncer ignore server age.
      As this behavior was undocumented, there should not be any users
      depending on it.
    * Internal improvements:
      - Packet buffers are allocated lazily and reused.  This should bring
        huge decrease in memory usage.  This also makes realistic to use
        big pktbuf with lot of connections.
      - Lot's of error handling improvements, PgBouncer should now
        survive OOM situations gracefully.
      - Use slab allocator for memory management.
      - Lots of code cleanups.

  = Fixes =

    * Only single accept() was issued per event loop which could
      cause connection backlog when having high amount of connection
      attempts.  Now the listening socket is always drained fully,
      which should fix this.
    * Handle EINTR from connect().
    * Make configure.ac compatible with autoconf 2.59.
    * Solaris compatibility fixes (Magne Mæhre)

2007-12-10  -  PgBouncer 1.1.2  -  "The Hammer"

  = Features =

    * Disconnects because of server_lifetime are now separated by
      (server_lifetime / pool_size) seconds.  This avoids pgbouncer
      causing reconnect floods.

  = Fixes =

    * Online upgrade 1.0 -> 1.1 problems:
      - 1.0 does not track server parameters, so they stay NULL
        but 1.1 did not expect it and crashed.
      - If server params are unknown, but client ones are set,
        then issue a SET for them, instead complaining.
    * Remove temp debug statements that were accidentally left
      in code on INFO level, so they polluted logs.
    * Unbroke debian/changelog

  = Cleanup =

    * reorder struct SBuf fields to get better alignment for buffer.

2007-10-26  -  PgBouncer 1.1.1  -  "Breakdancing Bee"

  = Fixes =

  * Server parameter cache could stay uninitialized, which caused
    unnecessary SET of them.  This caused problem on 8.1 which
    does not allow touching standard_conforming_strings.
    (Thanks to Dimitri Fontaine for report & testing.)

  * Some doc fixes.
  * Include doc/fixman.py in .tgz.

2007-10-09  -  PgBouncer 1.1  -  "Mad-Hat Toolbox"

  = Features =

  * Keep track of following server parameters:

      client_encoding  datestyle, timezone, standard_conforming_strings

  * Database connect string enhancements:
    - Accept hostname in host=
    - Accept custom unix socket location in host=
    - Accept quoted values: password=' asd''foo'

  * New config var: server_reset_query, to be sent immidiately after release
  * New config var: server_round_robin, to switch between LIFO and RR.
  * Cancel pkt sent for idle connection does not drop it anymore.
  * Cancel with ^C from psql works for SUSPEND / PAUSE.
  * Print FD limits on startup.
  * When suspending, try to hit packet boundary ASAP.
  * Add 'timezone' to database parameters.
  * Use longlived logfile fd.  Reopened on SIGHUP / RELOAD;
  * Local connection endpoint info in SHOW SERVERS/CLIENTS/SOCKETS.

  = Code cleanup =

  * More debug log messages include socket info.
  * Magic number removal and error message cleanup. (David Fetter)
  * Wrapper struct for current pkt info.  Removes lot of compexity.

  = Fixes =

  * Detect invalid pkt headers better.
  * auth_file modification check was broken, which made pgbouncer
    reload it too often.

2007-06-18  -  PgBouncer 1.0.8  -  "Undead Shovel Jutsu"

  = Fixes =

  * Fix crash in cancel packet handling. (^C from psql)

  = Features =

  * PAUSE <db>; RESUME <db>; works now.
  * Cleanup of console command parsing.
  * Disable expensive in-list assert check.

2007-04-19  -  PgBouncer 1.0.7  -  "With Vitamin A-Z"

  * Several error/notice packets with send() blocking between
    triggered assert.  Fix it by removing flushing logic altogether.
    As pgbouncer does not actively buffer anything, its not needed.
    It was a remnant from the time when buffering was pushed to
    kernel with MSG_MORE.
  * Additionally avoid calling recv() logic when sending unblocks.
  * List search code for admin_users and stats_users
    mishandled partial finds.  Fix it.
  * Standardise UNIX socket peer UID finding to getpeereid().

2007-04-12  -  PgBouncer 1.0.6  -  "Daily Dose"

  * The "Disable maintenance during the takeover" fix could
    disable maintenance altogether.  Fix it.
  * Compilation fix for FreeBSD, <sys/ucred.h> requires <sys/param.h> there.
    Thanks go to Robert Gogolok for report.

2007-04-11  -  PgBouncer 1.0.5  -  "Enough for today"

  * Fix online-restart bugs:
    - Set ->ready for idle servers.
    - Remove obsolete code from use_client_socket()
    - Disable maintenance during the takeover.

2007-04-11  -  PgBouncer 1.0.4  -  "Last 'last' bug"

  * Notice from idle server tagged server dirty.
    release_server() did not expect it.  Fix it
    by dropping them.

2007-04-11  -  PgBouncer 1.0.3  -  "Fearless Fork"

  = Fixes =

  * Some error handling was missing in login path, so dying
    connection there could trigger asserts.
  * Cleanup of asserts in sbuf.c to catch problems earlier.
  * Create core when Assert() triggers.

  = New stuff =

  * New config vars: log_connections, log_disconnections,
    log_pooler_errors to turn on/off noise.
  * Config var: client_login_timeout to kill dead connections
    in login phase that could stall SUSPEND and thus online restart.

2007-03-28  -  PgBouncer 1.0.2  -  "Supersonic Spoon"

  * libevent may report a deleted event inside same loop.
    Avoid socket reuse for one loop.
  * release_server() from disconnect_client() didnt look
    it the packet was actually sent.

2007-03-15  -  PgBouncer 1.0.1  -  "Alien technology"

  = Fixes =

  * Mixed usage of cached and non-cached time, plus unsiged usec_t typedef
    created spurious query_timeout errors.
  * Fix rare case when socket woken up from send-wait could stay stalling.
  * More fair queueing of server connections.  Before, a new query could
    get a server connections before older one.
  * Delay server release until everything is guaranteed to be sent.

  = Features =

  * SHOW SOCKETS command to have detailed info about state state.
  * Put PgSocket ptr to log, to help tracking one connection.
  * In console, allow SELECT in place of SHOW.
  * Various code cleanups.

2007-03-13  -  PgBouncer 1.0  -  "Tuunitud bemm"

  * First public release.
