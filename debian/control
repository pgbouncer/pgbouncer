Description: Lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL
 PgBouncer is a PostgreSQL connection pooler. Any target application can be
 connected to pgbouncer as if it were a PostgreSQL server, and pgbouncer will
 create a connection to the actual server, or it will reuse one of its existing
 connections.
 .
 The aim of pgbouncer is to lower the performance impact of opening
 new connections to PostgreSQL.
