## Description

**pgbouncer** is a PostgreSQL connection pooler. Any target application
can be connected to **pgbouncer** as if it were a PostgreSQL server,
and **pgbouncer** will create a connection to the actual server, or it
will reuse one of its existing connections.

The aim of **pgbouncer** is to lower the performance impact of opening
new connections to PostgreSQL.

In order not to compromise transaction semantics for connection
pooling, **pgbouncer** supports several types of pooling when
rotating connections:

Session pooling

:   Most polite method. When a client connects, a server connection will
    be assigned to it for the whole duration the client stays connected. When
    the client disconnects, the server connection will be put back into the pool.
    This is the default method.

Transaction pooling

:   A server connection is assigned to a client only during a transaction.
    When PgBouncer notices that transaction is over, the server connection
    will be put back into the pool.

Statement pooling

:   Most aggressive method. The server connection will be put back into the
    pool immediately after a query completes. Multi-statement
    transactions are disallowed in this mode as they would break.

The administration interface of **pgbouncer** consists of some new
`SHOW` commands available when connected to a special "virtual"
database **pgbouncer**.

## Quick-start

Basic setup and usage is as follows.

1. Create a pgbouncer.ini file.  Details in **pgbouncer(5)**.  Simple example:

        [databases]
        template1 = host=localhost port=5432 dbname=template1

        [pgbouncer]
        listen_port = 6432
        listen_addr = localhost
        auth_type = md5
        auth_file = userlist.txt
        logfile = pgbouncer.log
        pidfile = pgbouncer.pid
        admin_users = someuser

2. Create a `userlist.txt` file that contains the users allowed in:

        "someuser" "same_password_as_in_server"

3. Launch **pgbouncer**:

        $ pgbouncer -d pgbouncer.ini

4. Have your application (or the **psql** client) connect to
   **pgbouncer** instead of directly to the PostgreSQL server:

        $ psql -p 6432 -U someuser template1

5. Manage **pgbouncer** by connecting to the special administration
   database **pgbouncer** and issuing `SHOW HELP;` to begin:

        $ psql -p 6432 -U someuser pgbouncer
        pgbouncer=# SHOW HELP;
        NOTICE:  Console usage
        DETAIL:
          SHOW [HELP|CONFIG|DATABASES|FDS|POOLS|CLIENTS|SERVERS|SOCKETS|LISTS|VERSION|...]
          SET key = arg
          RELOAD
          PAUSE
          SUSPEND
          RESUME
          SHUTDOWN
          [...]

6. If you made changes to the pgbouncer.ini file, you can reload it with:

        pgbouncer=# RELOAD;

## Command line switches

`-d`, `--daemon`
:   Run in the background. Without it, the process will run in the foreground.

    In daemon mode, setting `pidfile` as well as `logfile` or `syslog`
    is required.  No log messages will be written to stderr after
    going into the background.

    Note: Does not work on Windows; **pgbouncer** need to run as service there.

`-R`, `--reboot`
:   **DEPRECATED: Instead of this option use a rolling restart with multiple
    pgbouncer processes listening on the same port using so_reuseport instead**
    Do an online restart. That means connecting to the running process,
    loading the open sockets from it, and then using them.  If there
    is no active process, boot normally.
    Note: Works only if OS supports Unix sockets and the `unix_socket_dir`
    is not disabled in configuration.  Does not work on Windows.
    Does not work with TLS connections, they are dropped.

`-u` _USERNAME_, `--user=`_USERNAME_
:   Switch to the given user on startup.

`-v`, `--verbose`
:   Increase verbosity.  Can be used multiple times.

`-q`, `--quiet`
:   Be quiet: do not log to stderr.  This does not affect
    logging verbosity, only that stderr is not to be used.
    For use in init.d scripts.

`-V`, `--version`
:   Show version.

`-h`, `--help`
:   Show short help.

`--regservice`
:   Win32: Register pgbouncer to run as Windows service.  The **service_name**
    configuration parameter value is used as the name to register under.

`--unregservice`
:   Win32: Unregister Windows service.

## Admin console

The console is available by connecting as normal to the
database **pgbouncer**:

    $ psql -p 6432 pgbouncer

Only users listed in the configuration parameters **admin_users** or **stats_users**
are allowed to log in to the console.  (Except when `auth_type=any`, then
any user is allowed in as a stats_user.)

Additionally, the user name **pgbouncer** is allowed to log in without password,
if the login comes via the Unix socket and the client has same Unix user UID
as the running process.

The admin console currently only supports the simple query protocol.
Some drivers use the extended query protocol for all commands; these
drivers will not work for this.

sv_idle
:   Server connections that are unused and immediately usable for client queries.

sv_used
:   Server connections that have been idle for more than `server_check_delay`,
    so they need `server_check_query` to run on them before they can be used again.

sv_tested
:   Server connections that are currently running either `server_reset_query`
    or `server_check_query`.

sv_login
:   Server connections currently in the process of logging in.

maxwait
:   How long the first (oldest) client in the queue has waited, in seconds.
    If this starts increasing, then the current pool of servers does
    not handle requests quickly enough.  The reason may be either an overloaded

columns:

key
:   Configuration variable name

value
:   Configuration value

default

#### SHOW VERSION

Show the PgBouncer version string.

#### SHOW STATE

Show the PgBouncer state settings. Current states are active, paused and suspended.

### Process controlling commands

#### PAUSE [db]

PgBouncer tries to disconnect from all servers. Disconnecting each server connection
waits for that server connection to be released according to the server pool's pooling
mode (in transaction pooling mode, the transaction must complete, in statement mode,
the statement must complete, and in session pooling mode the client must disconnect).
The command will not return before all server connections have been disconnected.
To be used at the time of database restart.

If database name is given, only that database will be paused.

New client connections to a paused database will wait until **RESUME**
is called.

#### DISABLE db

Reject all new client connections on the given database.

#### ENABLE db

Allow new client connections after a previous **DISABLE** command.

#### RECONNECT [db]

Close each open server connection for the given database, or all
databases, after it is released (according to the pooling mode), even
if its lifetime is not up yet.  New server connections can be made
immediately and will connect as necessary according to the pool size
settings.

This command is useful when the server connection setup has changed,
for example to perform a gradual switchover to a new server.  It is
*not* necessary to run this command when the connection string in
pgbouncer.ini has been changed and reloaded (see **RELOAD**) or when
DNS resolution has changed, because then the equivalent of this
command will be run automatically.  This command is only necessary if
something downstream of PgBouncer routes the connections.

After this command is run, there could be an extended period where
some server connections go to an old destination and some server
connections go to a new destination.  This is likely only sensible
when switching read-only traffic between read-only replicas, or when
switching between nodes of a multimaster replication setup.  If all
connections need to be switched at the same time, **PAUSE** is
recommended instead.  To close server connections without waiting (for
example, in emergency failover rather than gradual switchover
scenarios), also consider **KILL**.

#### KILL db

Immediately drop all client and server connections on given database.

New client connections to a killed database will wait until **RESUME**
is called.

#### SUSPEND

All socket buffers are flushed and PgBouncer stops listening for data on them.
The command will not return before all buffers are empty.  To be used at the time
of PgBouncer online reboot.

New client connections to a suspended database will wait until
**RESUME** is called.

#### RESUME [db]

Resume work from previous **KILL**, **PAUSE**, or **SUSPEND** command.

#### SHUTDOWN

The PgBouncer process will exit.

#### RELOAD

The PgBouncer process will reload its configuration files and update
changeable settings.  This includes the main configuration file as
well as the files specified by the settings `auth_file` and
`auth_hba_file`.

PgBouncer notices when a configuration file reload changes the
connection parameters of a database definition.  An existing server
connection to the old destination will be closed when the server
connection is next released (according to the pooling mode), and new
server connections will immediately use the updated connection
parameters.

#### WAIT_CLOSE [db]

Wait until all server connections, either of the specified database or
of all databases, have cleared the "close_needed" state (see **SHOW
SERVERS**).  This can be called after a **RECONNECT** or **RELOAD** to
wait until the respective configuration change has been fully
activated, for example in switchover scripts.

### Other commands

#### SET key = arg

Changes a configuration setting (see also **SHOW CONFIG**).  For example:

    SET log_connections = 1;
    SET server_check_query = 'select 2';

(Note that this command is run on the PgBouncer admin console and sets
PgBouncer settings.  A **SET** command run on another database will be
passed to the PostgreSQL backend like any other SQL command.)

### Signals

SIGHUP
:   Reload config. Same as issuing the command **RELOAD** on the console.

SIGINT
:   Safe shutdown. Same as issuing **PAUSE** and **SHUTDOWN** on the console.

SIGTERM
:   Immediate shutdown. Same as issuing **SHUTDOWN** on the console.

SIGUSR1
:   Same as issuing **PAUSE** on the console.

SIGUSR2
:   Same as issuing **RESUME** on the console.

### Libevent settings

From the Libevent documentation:

> It is possible to disable support for epoll, kqueue, devpoll, poll
> or select by setting the environment variable EVENT_NOEPOLL,
> EVENT_NOKQUEUE, EVENT_NODEVPOLL, EVENT_NOPOLL or EVENT_NOSELECT,
> respectively.
>
> By setting the environment variable EVENT_SHOW_METHOD, libevent
> displays the kernel notification method that it uses.
